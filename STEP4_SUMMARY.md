# Step 4 Summary: Digital Sourcing & Partner Onboarding Backend Module Completed

## ✅ Completed Objectives

Successfully developed a comprehensive Digital Sourcing & Partner Onboarding backend module with API endpoints for hospital registration, document management, evaluation scoring, contract generation, and digital signatures.

## 🎯 Key Implementations

### 1. **Hospital Application System** ✅
- **Submission API**: `/api/onboarding/applications/submit`
  - Validates Nigerian phone numbers
  - Captures hospital details and proposed location
  - Generates unique application numbers (APP-YYYYMM-XXXX)
  - Stores business plans and specializations

### 2. **Document Management** ✅
- **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/onboarding/applications/:id/documents`
  - Secure file upload with multer
  - Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG formats
  - 10MB file size limit
  - Document type categorization
  - Verification tracking

### 3. **Automated Evaluation Scoring** ✅
- **Intelligent Scoring System**:
  - Infrastructure assessment (20 points)
  - Staffing evaluation (20 points)
  - Equipment verification (20 points)
  - Location strategic value (20 points)
  - Financial viability (20 points)
- **Nigerian Context Scoring**:
  - Strategic states prioritization (Lagos, FCT, Rivers, etc.)
  - Urban vs rural considerations
  - Bed capacity weighting
- **Automated Decisions**:
  - Score ≥ 70: Auto-approved
  - Score 50-69: Documents requested
  - Score < 50: Rejected
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk level calculation

### 4. **Contract Generation** ✅
- **Comprehensive Templates**:
  - Full Nigerian legal framework
  - NDPR compliance clauses
  - Payment schedules in Naira
  - Service level agreements
  - Termination clauses
- **Dynamic Generation**:
  - Hospital-specific terms
  - Commission rate calculation (5-15%)
  - Revenue share options
  - Automatic contract numbering (CNT-YYYYMM-XXXX)

### 5. **Digital Signature System** ✅
- **Secure Signing Process**:
  - SHA-256 signature hashing
  - Dual-party signing support
  - Timestamp verification
  - Signature storage
- **Contract Activation**: Auto-activates when both parties sign
- **Hospital Status Update**: Updates hospital to ACTIVE upon contract completion

## 📊 API Endpoints Created

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth Required |

| `/api/onboarding/applications` | GET | Get all applications | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/applications/:id` | GET | Get single application | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/applications/:id/status` | PATCH | Update application status | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/applications/:id/documents` | POST | Upload application document | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/applications/:id/progress` | GET | Get onboarding progress | No |
| `/api/onboarding/applications/evaluate` | POST | Evaluate application | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/contracts/generate` | POST | Generate contract | Yes |
| `/api/onboarding/contracts/sign` | POST | Sign contract digitally | Yes |

## 🔧 Technical Components

### Services Created:
1. **EvaluationService**: Automated scoring with Nigerian context
2. **ContractTemplateService**: HTML/PDF contract generation
3. **OnboardingController**: Main business logic
4. **Authentication Middleware**: JWT-based security

### Database Updates:
- HospitalApplication table with all fields
- ApplicationDocument for file tracking
- Contract management tables
- Digital signature storage

## 📈 Nigerian Context Features

1. **Location Scoring**:
   - Strategic states: Lagos, FCT, Kano, Rivers (12 points)
   - Secondary states: Anambra, Delta, Edo (8 points)
   - Other states: 4 points

2. **Phone Validation**:
   - Nigerian format: +234XXXXXXXXXX or 0XXXXXXXXXX

3. **Contract Terms**:
   - Nigerian legal framework
   - NDPR compliance
   - Naira currency throughout
   - Local arbitration clauses

4. **Business Evaluation**:
   - NHIS integration readiness
   - HMO compatibility
   - Local staffing requirements

## 🧪 Testing Results

Successfully tested application submission:
```json
{
  "applicationNumber": "APP-202510-5586",
  "hospitalName": "Lagos General Hospital",
  "status": "SUBMITTED",
  "proposedBedCapacity": 150
}
```
